                two phases. The first phase was for the powerliters. During the
                first phase we focused on functionality and convinence. The
                second phase was aimed more towards the casual gym members.
                During this phase we focused on improved functionality and
                aesthetics. The first phase of the Swoly is avalible for

                A movie database app, designed and developed by myself and
                Griffin Melson. This app was a semester long project for CS2300
                (Databases and Intro to File Structures). During the span of
                the semester we went through many phases. The first phase was
                the conceptual phase were we designed the Ehnanced Entity
                Relational model and overall functionality of the app. The
                second phase was where we designed the UI and normalized the
                EER diagram. The last and final phase was the phase were we
                built the application and presented it during class for peer
                review.

                This app is a mixture of a proof of concept for an Electron app
                as well as a revamp for my senior project. During my senior
                year of high school I was enterd into the FBLA Desktop
                Application competion. The task for that year was to create a
                desktop application that would store information of all the
                member of FBLA. The intial revision of that application was
                written with VB.NET and used an Access file as the "Database".
                It was functional and did everything that the specs required
                but there was no SQL in the entire source code. Hearing that
                Node js and Electron offered cross platform app development and
                deployment, I knew exactly what to use for my first crack at
                that framework.
